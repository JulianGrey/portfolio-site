# Portfolio Site

A space within the interwebtubes to showcase my ability to communicate with a computer through a keyboard.

JulianGrey.dev acts as a window looking into my development life. First created in 2014 using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery, I have resurrected and rewritten the code in React to provide a platform to eventually house and link directly to projects past, present and eventually future.

Currently there aren't any completed projects that I am happy to show on my website, however I am considering putting work-in-progress projects on my website to have more of a living process be made public and ready available for all to see.

The centrepiece of my website is what I call the "Navgrid", a crossword-style navigation which shows different content depending on which word you click.

Back in 2014 this was purely desktop, as I failed to come up with a functional design or method to make the feature work on a smaller screen. However eleven years later nine years into my career, I was able to use a technique that I learnt and implemented into the mobile site of an online casino to get around this issue. The button and modal combo, simple yet effective.
