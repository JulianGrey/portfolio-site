# Portfolio Site

A space within the interwebtubes to showcase my ability to communicate with a computer through a keyboard.

This website is based off my old portfolio site from 2014, which at the time was written using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery alone. This repository looks to restore this site, rewriting it using the React framework, updating legacy code and restructuring self-made systems to be more modular and fit the React methodology.
